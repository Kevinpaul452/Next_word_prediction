## Problem Statement

The problem is to develop a next-word prediction model capable of generating contextually relevant words based on a given input sequence of text. The code addresses this by utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network well-suited for handling sequential data like text.

## Key Aspects:

### Text Preprocessing: 
The code reads and cleans a text corpus, tokenizes it using Keras' Tokenizer, and converts word sequences into numerical sequences.
### LSTM Model: 
An LSTM-based neural network is constructed with embedding, LSTM layers, and dense layers to learn patterns and dependencies within the text data.
### Training: 
The model is trained on sequences of 5 words, predicting the 6th word. Categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer are used for training.
### Prediction: 
A function is implemented to predict the next word given an input text, using the trained model and tokenizer.
### User Interaction: 
The code provides a loop for users to input text and obtain real-time next-word predictions.
